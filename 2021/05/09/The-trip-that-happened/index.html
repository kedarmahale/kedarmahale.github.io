            <p>Many times we come across people saying, <em>“let’s go on a trip”</em>, <em>“chalo na yaar, Goa chalte haii!!”</em>. We know what happens next, yeah! you guessed it right!! Such trips never happen. I and a group of friends from my college have a similar story, except the ending, which you must have guessed by now from the title of this post.</p>
<p>Now, what happens next? Of course, you need a place to go on a trip, right? And being from <strong>Goa</strong>, you can’t go on a trip to Goa….. So how do you decide on a place, a very difficult question to ask!</p>
<p>Our group consists of nine people, six guys, and three girls. We had our trip planner guy, you give him the budget and he comes up with an excellent plan, such that you end up saving a little on your budget too (depends on how you spend though!). Coming to the question of choosing a place, we had a few options in mind, and given the budget, we couldn’t afford to fly (if we want to go to a very distant place). </p>
<p>Kerela, Darjeeling, Uttarakhand (way out of the question!), and Rajasthan were some of the options. Now to choose a place, we had a rule and that was through a vote. A place that gains 2&#x2F;3 of the majority is the place we visit. I had visited Jaipur (Rajasthan) before and given the condition (no offense) of the place, I was against it. And somehow we chose to go to Rajasthan, no regrets now though.</p>
<p>Convincing your parents is the next part of this recipe….and I had no problems doing that, but I wasn’t going alone on the trip. There were a few hurdles here and there, but we were able to overcome them, it was like each of them sipped a luck potion before asking their parents. Things were going our way. </p>
<p>We planned for December 2019, the last month of one of the happiest years I remember. We decided to take the rail route. It was supposed to be approximately 40 hrs. of journey. I have always been fond of railway journeys, especially these long journeys… as they say <em>“journey is beautiful than the destination”</em> and it was! (ok no more spoilers).</p>
<p>We were in the final year of engineering, one of the most beautiful years of engineering life. The trip was in December, which means after the end sems. Also, there was the pressure of getting placed so that we could enjoy and chill the hell out of the trip.</p>
<p>After a long wait, we were all set to go! The train was scheduled for 08 December 2019 at 04:00 a.m. I was very excited about this trip, to be honest, I am always excited about trips.</p>
<p>Let’s continue with the journey in the next post! Stay tuned!!</p>
