### Day 2, Jodhpur

Tired from the previos day, I got up in my bed early in the morning. Yes, I get up early, before anyone else does except on very important occassions when it is actually needed. There was complementary breakfast for us, so I called up to ask and yes you guessed it right, _poha_ was one of the choices and the other was _plain-parotha_. _Aur kya hi expect kare, atleast diya tho sahi_.

So, heading to our next place to visit....Mandoore gardens it was. As usual we took a cab, and lucky enough we all reached safely. Mandoore gardens as the name suggests is a garden, with many and when I say many, I mean manyyyy old temples. A beautiful garden, maintained pretty well. We wandered around looking within the temples, they were not very clean from within and a bit stinky to be honest. They were not usual temples though, there was no idol inside them, also few of them had steps so that you could access the higher floor. The access to these steps was closed, so we couldn't go up. 

Almost all of them were similar with same kind of architecture. Each temple was surrounded by some grass, like a garden with few small trees. A typical rajasthani style traditional wedding was happening in one of the temples, which was quite a normal temple as compared to all others.

There was a small musuem inside, so we went inside. UU was of the opinion that I click good candids, he's not wrong though. He decided to stay around me, hoping he would get clicked in a good shot. And as you must have predicted it, good canidis dont happen just like that XD.

There were few paintings and artifacts, the usual musuem stuff. I guess we all got bored here and wanted to chill. So, we all sat on a bench and started to gossip. We didn't want to go anywhere or do anything.....just chill. After some time, we got up from there and started wandering around again. Now, we were at the entrance of the garden and not sure where to go, it was almost lunch time. There comes a time on a trip, when you'll get frustrated maybe because of the place or some other reason, just have patience and don't let the group break!

There is this cool restauarnt in Jodhpur, called Gypsy restaurant.
