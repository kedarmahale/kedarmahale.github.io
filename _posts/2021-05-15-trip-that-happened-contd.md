## Padharo mhaaro des

We reached Jodhpur, managed to find a place to stay. How? HH(our travel expert) had booked a hotel through an online platform, we went and checked it first. It wasn't so good. But then HH and HP decided to have a toss, if it was in favour of HH, we would stay there or else we go to a place which HP choose. Latter turned out to be true, the hotel wasn't that bad afterall. 

### Day 1, Jodhpur

It was still morning, Rajasthan is pretty cold in December. Chilly air was blowing, environment felt pretty fresh. We were standing outside the hotel, waiting for a cab. HH had decided a place to have breakfast. We reached the place, it was on the first floor of an old shady building. Honestly, I felt all buildings there were old. This place was pretty nice, no crowd, I guess because it was morning. 

SJ and SM decided to order _pyaaz kachori_, rest all and indecisive me ordered _chhole bhature_, _aur uss_ _chhole bhauture ki mai kya hi tarrif karu, pyaar hi ho gaya!!_. I guess the best one I ever had.

Since, we liked _Chhole Bahture_ so much, we decided to try one more dish, it was _badami aloo puri_. I was so full with the _chhole bhature_ that I could'nt even taste the other dish.
