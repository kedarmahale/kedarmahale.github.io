## Padharo mhaaro des

We reached Jodhpur, managed to find a place to stay. How? HH(our travel expert) had booked a hotel through an online platform, we went and checked it first. It wasn't so good. But then HH and HP decided to have a toss, if it was in favour of HH, we would stay there or else we go to a place which HP choose. Latter turned out to be true, the hotel wasn't that bad afterall. 

### Day 1, Jodhpur

It was still morning, Rajasthan is pretty cold in December. Chilly air was blowing, environment felt pretty fresh. We were standing outside the hotel, waiting for a cab. HH had decided a place to have breakfast. We reached the place, it was on the first floor of an old shady building. Honestly, I felt all buildings there were old. This place was pretty nice, no crowd, I guess because it was morning. 

SJ and SM decided to order _pyaaz kachori_, rest all and indecisive me ordered _chhole bhature_, _aur uss_ _chhole bhauture ki mai kya hi tarrif karu, pyaar hi ho gaya!!_. I guess the best one I ever had.

Since, we liked _Chhole Bahture_ so much, we decided to try one more dish, it was _badami aloo puri_. I was so full with the _chhole bhature_ that I could'nt even taste the other dish. But, my friends told me that it was good, so I'll believe them.

We left the place, decided to go to Umaid bhavan, a loactaion which was closest from our present location. Looking around, I was quite disappointed becuase the cleanliness at the railway station had set a different standard of hygine. Ola auto was what we decided to take. HP, SJ, MT got an auto and went together, Mi, HH, SM also got an auto and went together. I, MB and UU were left together. To my tough luck, MB's tough luck got added and we couldn't find an auto for a very long time. We were so frustrated that we wanted to walk there, but it was too far(_itni mehnat kaun karega?_).

We thought, all of them must have already reached and even looked around the place. After a long time somehow, we managed to get an auto and reached the location. So, what next? Time to chill around!

Umaid Bhavan is heritage hotel, a musuem, and the residence of the royal family. People are allowed to visit only the musuem part of this place. There is a small fee which you need to pay to enter the musuem. The musuem guards are also smart enough, they try to pursuade you that they can guide you through, and ask for money in return.

There was a musuem of heritage cars on the outer side, so we decided to have a look at it first. There were pretty cars out there. They take good care of their cars and maintain them well. Then we went inside, astonishingly, photography is allowed inside. We took a lot of pictures inside. There are many artefacts, ornaments lot of pictures put up for display inside the musuem. All pretty and well maintained. Overall it was nice, by the time we finished looking around, it was almost noon. _Chhole bhature_ were so fulfiling, that I decided to skip my lunch, I guess eveyone did.
