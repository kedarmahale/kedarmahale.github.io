### Day 8, Udaipur - last day in Rajasthan

After seven days, which did not seem a long time, this trip was coming to an end. There was a bit of sadness in everyone's eyes. Also we were missing our homes back in Goa. That day we met in the hotel lobby. Since we did not want to stay for the day in the hotel, we checked out and requested the hotel owner to look after our bags. Which he willingly agreed. 

We did not have much to do today, few of us wanted to visit animal shelter and few wanted to visit Mewar fort if I am not wrong. Both of the locations turned out to be way too far from Udaipur, so we dropped the plan. So what could we do? We went out on a walk and we were jamming on songs, of which I remember this<a href="https://youtu.be/zZasH6qkn8M"> KK's classic</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/9PXsfrc420w"> Awari</a>. This was a lot of fun. We reached near _lake Pichola_ as we were walking, still jamming on songs. We were chilling, taking pictures, _maja aaa raha thaa_. 

Then we decided we should visit _Sahelion ki Bari_. 

Countless number of trips get planned among friends, but how many of them make it to the reality? The answer as we all know, is very few. One such trip which happened was coming to an end. Exploring new places with your close friends is a different kind of experience filled with fun, joy, lots of learning and a lot more.
