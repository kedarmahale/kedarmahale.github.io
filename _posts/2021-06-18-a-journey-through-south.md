Have you ever been on an instantaneous trip? One fine day, out of nowhere your friend texts you... want to go on a trip? You reply "yes", thinking this might be a joke. And then all of a sudden you get added to a WhatsApp group with eight other people, right in the middle of a discussion getting bombarded with loads of messages. This was just a discussion though, and chances of a WhatsApp group making it to an actual trip are very slim (10% ?). 

We are a group of people who fall in that 10%. It was in November 2018, when we were in the third year, end sems was around the corner and all that we were doing were planning for a trip. HH, our travel expert (if you read my previous series, you don't need his introduction) was in the process of booking tickets, surfing through hotels over online platforms, and the rest of us were busy studying for exams, which resulted in HH scoring low marks in exams. We had planned for a trip in the first week of December 2018, right after our end sems. 

So where were we going? As the title says south, we were going to Mysore and Ooty. Initially, we had also planned for _Coorg_, to which HP said, "_agar sirf places hi dekhna hai jaldi-jaldi toh Sri Lanka bhi chale jaate hai_". He made sense though, just skimming through places doesn't make sense and isn't fun either. Also, the budget needs to be taken care of ("_nahi toh chale jaate Sri Lanka_"). We were supposed to leave Goa on December 2nd reach Mysore on the 3rd morning. This time we were going by bus, _Kadamba Volvo_, the flagship product of KTCL. This bus has never disappointed me. To be honest, I am a huge fan of Volvo and I love traveling in their buses.

### The journey.

MB and HH would directly meet us in Mysore since they were attending something. The rest of us would go together. The bus was scheduled at 3:00 p.m. from _Panjim_ and would reach _Mysore_ at 06:00 a.m. the next day. I and HP met at _Panjim_, the rest of them would get on the bus in the way. Mi was supposed to get on the bus at _Banastarim_, he underestimated the speed of the bus and almost missed it. Thanks to HP, who requested the driver to wait, Mi was able to catch the bus. 

The rest of them got on the bus at _Ponda_. It was just a normal journey, many seats on the bus were not occupied. However, one annoying guy was sitting diagonally in front of us. He was talking over the phone(loudly) the entire night, as soon as we thought his phone battery was over, he would take a power bank out of his bag. When his power bank ran out of power, he took out another one. His phone be like, "_Saans tho lene dey bey!_". 

At night, the bus halted somewhere for dinner. As usual, Mi wasn't impressed with the quality, I guess even with the quantity. The journey continued after a while. It was past midnight, the bus was traversing through the _western ghats_, visibility was very poor. _Ghats_ and _Volvo_(with a Kadamba driver) are a pair made in heaven. And to top it off, the crew members were discussing some interesting horror stories. If I remember correctly, the one in the driver's seat was telling a horrific incident that happened with him in the past while driving through the ghats. This was shit scary and I was able to listen to them as I couldn't even sleep.

It was getting cold on the bus due to the A/C. The bus halted again at _Shimoga_. Since it was cold on the bus, we decided to get down. Little did we know, A/C temperature was higher than the temperature outside. It was freaking cold outside, and I was shivering. I quickly got back on the bus. I was excited about reaching _Mysore_ but somehow I managed to sleep. We had reached _Mysore_ when someone calls my name and I wake up. We were actually in _Mysore_ and the bus managed to reach exactly at 06:00 a.m. However, the _Mysore_ I saw in my dream looked better than the actual one, never mind. 

Let us continue the journey in the next post. Stay tuned!
