### Day 1, Mysore

The bus stopped at Mysore bus station. As soon as we got down off the bus, we were surrounded by a lot of taxi guys.  We decided to move out of the bus station and then booked cabs. HP booked a cab and Mi booked an auto so that we could go to the hotel. One of the few problems of going to the south is, the natives assume that we understand their native language. HP's cab driver called and started speaking in _Kannada_, it took him a while to understand that we don't understand _Kannada_. HP left with the girls and I, Mi and UU went in the auto. It was cold, while on the way, the auto suddenly stopped. The engine wasn't firing again. Fortunately, it started after a while and we were able to reach the hotel.

When we reached, we saw MB and HH were already there and HP had occupied the extra bed in their room. So it was I, Mi and UU to be staying in a room together. The problem with this room was that one person had to sleep on the floor. Seeing the size of the bed, I decided to sleep on the floor. We freshened up and met at the hotel lobby. This was an instantaneous trip, so we did not get time to make an itinerary. We had to decide where we would go, MB was familiar with Mysore, so we left the decision up to him.

We entered a restaurant nearby to have breakfast. It wasn't a very fancy place but was just good enough. We were the only guests at the restaurant.

After this, we took a bus to _Chamundi hills_. _Mysore_ is a very well-planned city, clean, and roads are designed such that traffic congestion is minimal. The public transport is also very clean. 

_Chamundi hills_ as the name suggests is a hill. On the hill-top is a temple, which looks pretty decent. It was crowded so we decided to just look around the temple. It is a very clean place. As you walk down the hill, at a walking distance is situated the _Bull temple_. The road to reach this temple is accessible only by foot. On the way, you can see the overwhelming view of _Mysore city_ from the top. We stopped, at a place to fill our eyes with the beautiful view. After walking for a while, we reached the _Bull temple_. There is a huge idol as you can see from the image.

We wandered around the hill for some time and reached the bus stop where we could catch a bus back to the city. Next, we decided to go to a zoo. There is this very famous zoo in _Mysore_, _Sri Chamarajendra Zoological Gardens_. By the time we reached there, it was almost noon. The zoo was a normal zoo from inside with the usual zoo stuff. We looked around the zoo for some time, till all of us were hungry. There was a canteen within the zoo campus. So, we decided to eat there. Since we were in _Mysore_, we wanted to try something traditional. On being asked MB recommended we should have _Bisibele bhaat_. Simply put, it's rice with a lot of vegetables. It was very fulfilling and most of us couldn't even finish half of it.

I was feeling lethargic after the fulfilling lunch. We looked around the zoo for some more time and then left. Next, we decided to go to _St. Philomena's Cathedral_. Unfortunately, a part of it was under construction so we couldn't get a complete picture of it from outside. At least, we were allowed inside. It's beautiful from the inside with all the stuff a church would have. The architecture seemed European. HH was the only one then who had a camera with a wide-angle lens, so we wanted him to click a picture of each one of us with the church. He was kind enough to listen to us.

After this, we went to our next place. It was a railway museum. It's called _Mysuru rail musuem_. This museum has a few old locomotives which were decommissioned, bogies, coaches, etc. A brief history of the railways in India is displayed in a separate room. The best part was, we were the only people at this museum. I remember recreating a scene from _DDLJ_ on one of the coaches. _Maja aaa gaya!_. We had some fun here, chilled, and then decided to go to the famous _Vrundavan gardens_.

Most of us have read about the _Vrundavan garden_ from school textbooks. I was excited to check out whether the description matches in reality, and it does. It's even prettier in person. It is an enormous garden spread on the banks of the dam. The entry towards the dam is restricted, so we could not go there. There are many water fountains, a lake in the middle, overall it is pretty. There is a fountain show scheduled every night at 07:00 p.m., so we waited for it. I could see people there being very excited about it. Honestly, I felt it was just a normal fountain show. After this, we decided to leave. It was almost dark, we came towards the bus stop, there weren't many buses to go back to the city.

After waiting for a while, a bus came. There was a huge rush of people to get on the bus. We were all able to get a seat. We witnessed people fighting over a seat, with one man shouting "_touch kyu kiya!?_" and the other man shouting back at him. It had been a very long day, we reached the city bus stand and somehow we were very tired from all the walking that we did. HH wanted to have dinner at a fancy restaurant, so he suggested we walk for another small distance to reach a restaurant of his choice (note - his choice is very good). SJ was so pissed after walking for a while but then felt good after reaching the restaurant. It was on the top-most floor of a tall building and they allowed us to sit in a separate room. It was a perfect end to a day.

Stay tuned for the next part!
