## The journey - beautiful than the destination?

4:00 a.m., Margao railway station was where the train was supposed to arrive from Coimbatore. As it was a very absurd time to reach the railway station, I and Hv decided to stay at Mb's place for the night, since his place was very close to the railway station. Our other friend Sw would join us directly on the train, and Su would join us in Panvel on the train and rest would meet up at the railway station. 

As usual, the train was late. They were good old covid19 free days, no mask, nothing, just fresh air. It was early morning, so I decided to have a cup of tea, railway station tea has a different taste and vibe. _"Wo rail ka safar hi kyaaa, jiski shuruwat ek chai se naa ho?"_ The train arrived after another hour, not bad. 

We boarded the train, given the time, it was pretty dark inside as everyone was sleeping. It was almost a mini-orchestra of snoring. I reached my seat, which as usual was the upper berth. I hadn't slept the previous night as I was playing ETS 2 with my friend Mb, yes we both like trucks! So, I decided I should sleep. It was suppposed to be a long journey, I did not carry much food in the train, so sleeping was a better option to keep hunger out of question.

I got up in the afternoon when the train was about to reach Panve. I missed all the action in between, I assume everyone else was sleeping too. Su brought some food for us. The not so fun part was, Hv and Mi, were in other bogey and it was miles apart from ours. We met once during the journey to exchange some food. The train has "super-fast" in its name, and I guess it was pretty much justifying it's name. 

As per the itenerary, we were supposed to go to Jodhpur first, which is the southest og all the locations. We had booked a hotel on an online platform. The hotels in Rajastan were having some differences with this online platform and as a result they cancelled the hotel. We were supposed to reach the next morning, no stay? where do we go? Let's see that later, that was the conclusion of our discussion.

Around 08:00 p.m. we reached Baroda railway station. The dhokla there was pretty cheap, I felt it was good given the taste. _Kabhi gaye tho, try karke dekh lena_.
