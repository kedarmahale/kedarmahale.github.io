## The journey - beautiful than the destination?

4:00 a.m., Margao railway station was where the train was supposed to arrive from Coimbatore. As it was a very absurd time to reach the railway station, I and Hv decided to stay at Mb's place for the night, since his place was very close to the railway station. Our other friend Sw would join us directly on the train, and Su would join us in Panvel on the train and rest would meet up at the railway station. 

As usual, the train was late. They were good old covid19 free days, no mask, nothing, just fresh air. It was early morning, so I decided to have a cup of tea, railway station tea has a different taste and vibe. _"Wo rail ka safar hi kyaaa, jiski shuruwat ek chai se naa ho?"_ The train arrived after another hour, not bad. 

We boarded the train, given the time, it was pretty dark inside as everyone was sleeping. It was almost a mini-orchestra of snoring. I reached my seat, which was usual was the upper berth. I hadn't slept the previous night as I was playing ETS 2 with my friend Mb, yes we both like trucks! So, I decided I should sleep. It was suppposed to be a long journey, I did not carry much food so sleeping was a better option to keep hunger out of question.
