Many a times we come across people saying, _"lets go on a trip"_, _"chalo na yaar, Goa chalte haii!!"_. We know what happens next, yeah! you guessed it right!! Such trips never happen. Me and a group of friends from my college have a similar story, except the ending, which you must have guessed by now from the title of this post.

Now, what happens next? Ofcourse you need a place to go on a trip, right? And being from **Goa**, you can't go on a trip to Goa..... So how do you decide a place, a very difficult question to ask!

Our group consists of nine people, six guys and three girls. We had our own trip planner guy, you give him the budget and he comes up with an excellent plan, such that you end up saving a little on your budget too (depends on how you spend though!). Coming to the question of choosing a place, we had a few options in mind and given the budget we couldn't afford to fly (if we want to go to a very distant place). 

Kerela, Darjeeling, Uttarakhand (way out of question!), and Rajasthan were some of the options. Now to choose a place, we had a rule and that was through vote. A place which gains 2/3 of the majority is the place we visit. I had visited Jaipur (Rajasthan) before and given the condition (no offence) of the place, I was against it. And somehow we chose to go to Rajasthan, no regrets now though.

Convincing your parents is the next part of this recepie....and I had no problems doing that, but I wasn't going alone on the trip. There were a few hurdles here and there, but we were able to overcome them, it was like each of them had a sip of luck potion before asking their parents. Things were going our way. 

We planned for December 2019, the last month of one of the happiest years I remember. We decided to take the rail route. It was supposed to be an approximately 40 hrs. of journey. I have always been fond of railway journeys, specially these long journeys... as they say _"journey is beautiful than destination"_ and literally it was! (ok no more spoilers).

We were in final year of engineering, one of the most beautiful years of engineering life. Trip was in December, which means after the end sems. Also, there was a pressure of getting placed so that we could actually enjoy and chill the hell out of the trip.

After a really long wait, we were all set to go! Train was scheduled on 08 December 2019 at 04:00 a.m.. I was very excited for this trip, to be honest, I am always excited for trips.

Lets continue with the journey in next post! Stay tuned!!
